> My site is under active development, contributions welcome!

This is the source code of my personal website (future blog). Its based on the amazing **[GatsbyJS Framework](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)**!

In addition this project uses:

 - **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** including [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
 - **[react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)** for cool animations :sunglasses:
 - **JSON and Markdown** as a data source (using [remark](https://remark.js.org/))
 - **Code snippet syntax highlighting** with [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/)

Its deployed directly from this repo using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) :sparkles:

## The goals of this project

The main goal of this project is to **build a personal portfolio** and **overview of me and my work**.

I'm also using this project to learn more about gatsby, as this is my first time using it.

Also, learning to use **build and deployment pipelines** (such as netlify or CI in general) has been a long time goal for me. I started by setting up **automated builds and deployments** over on my [use-error-boundary](https://github.com/JoschuaSchneider/use-error-boundary) repo.

And lastly, making my projects publicly available **might help others** with their own project or learning process and **encourages me** (or them) **to give back to the community** :heart:
