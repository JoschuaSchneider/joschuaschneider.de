All the technologies I am using on a **regular basis**.
I have solid knowledge of all listed languages, tools, frameworks and services.

I'm always excited about the newest features and dive into them as soon as they come up,
so I am familiar with all features all the way up to `ECMAScript 9 (2018)`.

My react skills include concepts and libraries such as [redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux), [mobx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx),
[react context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), [react-spring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spring),
[styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components), [react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) (I love them),
[react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) (and the [DOM bindings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom))
and many more.

Although my projects mostly cover the entire stack (frontend, backend / database), I'll happily design and build just a part of it.
So if your project is a **API**, a **frontend** to an existing api or just a **static site**, I got you covered!
