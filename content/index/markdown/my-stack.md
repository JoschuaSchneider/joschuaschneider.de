Technologies I'm using on a **regular basis**, backed by solid in-depth knowledge.

_All the newest language features? OH Y-**ES7**!_

The majority of projects I am or have been working on are based on **React**.  
My **React skills** include concepts and libraries such as [redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux), [mobx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx),
[react context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), [react-spring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spring),
[styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components), [react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html),
[react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)
and many more.

When building Full-Stack Projects, my stack mostly consists of **node, express and mongodb**.  
Often in combination with **Next**, **Meteor** or **Gatsby**.

**I always build my projects with security, performance and scalability in mind.**
