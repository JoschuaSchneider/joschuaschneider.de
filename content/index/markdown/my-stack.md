All the technologies I am using on a **regular basis**, backed by solid in-depth knowledge.

I'm always excited about the newest features and dive into them as soon as they come up,
so I am familiar with all features all the way up to **ECMAScript 9 (2018)**.

My react skills include concepts and libraries such as [redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux), [mobx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx),
[react context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), [react-spring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spring),
[styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components), [react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) (I love them),
[react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) (including [DOM bindings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom))
and many more.

You just need a part of the stack? No problem!  
**APIs**, **frontends** to existing APIs or **static pages**, I got you covered!

I'm familiar with a variety of common best practices and standards, to ensure consistency and maintainablility of
the projects that I work on.

My ability to handle, understand and break down complex structures helps me build **secure, performant and scalable software** -
or dive fast into existing projects
