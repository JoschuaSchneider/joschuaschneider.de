#### Building software driven by passion

---

I'm a **passionate** JavaScript/Web Developer and student based in Germany :man_technologist::flag_de:

My **confidence** is based on four years of **professional expertise** and over eight years of programming in total.

Although I gained most of my skills and experience myself,
I currently **study IT** in Hanover to **expand my scientific knowledge** :man_student:

I co-founded a startup in 2016, worked with customers and companies to plan, develop and deploy Full-Stack Web Applications.

My intuition, calmness and strive for in-depth knowledge constitutes my ability to solve even the most complex Problems fast
and effective :muscle:
