Hey, my name is **Joschua** and I'm a 21 year old developer and IT-Student from Hanover, Germany.

I **design**, **build** and **maintain** Web Applications powered by **Javascript**.
My passion for programming is a result of over eight years of experience, including 4 years of professional expertise.
Since co-founding a startup in 2016 and by managing and developing large projects,
I have shifted my work to a professional level.

Even though I am studying IT, most of my knowledge and skill is **self-taught**.
When it comes to new languages, concepts, frameworks or tools I am able to build
a **deep understanding extremely fast**.
I build my **confidence in problem solving** by diving into the inner works of a language or library.
Where other people claim to know everything, **I continue to challenge myself** with new aspects of
even the most basic features of a language or library.

As a result of my philosophy I love to **share knowledge** and **help others** overcome all kind of problems.
Thats why I am an active member of the **OpenSource community** on [github](https://github.com/JoschuaSchneider).
