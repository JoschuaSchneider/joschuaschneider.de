You were probably referred here from one of my friends or projects.  

I build and maintain some projects **free of charge** and for fun, if you find them useful
and want to **show your support**, you can use my PayPal donate link to keep up my **coffee supply-chain** :coffee:!

If the project you're donating for has a supporters list and you want to be mentioned, provide me with the name of the project
and your desired display name!

**Thank you for supporting what I do!**

Special thanks to my friend, owner of [Nakama Streaming Community](https://nakama.tv) for
years of support, interesting projects and letting me influence his personal skills :thumbsup:
