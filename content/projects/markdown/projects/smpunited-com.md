**The website for a community Minecraft Server**

The server itself is also a project of mine, utilizing a lot of Java programming and network management.

This project is based on:

- **[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)**
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** including [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- **JSON and Markdown** as a data source (using [remark](https://remark.js.org/))
