Fullstack application built with `node`, `express` and `mongodb`.
Frontend for administration with `react`.  
And also stream overlays to come!

A feature rich **twitch and discord** bot under active development for the folks over at [nakama streaming community](https://nakama.tv/).

It combines an administrative layer (user and sub-user management with permissions, invites, custom commands etc.) with a real-time
bot layer for both `twitch` and `discord`. Utilizing a complex permission system, message logs, external APIs, websockets and built with scaling in mind.

There is a huge Roadmap for this project and so many features to come!

Closed source and under development. Links will be added once launched.
