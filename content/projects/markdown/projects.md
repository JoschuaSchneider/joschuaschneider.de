Here is a **small excerpt** of the projects I am/have been working on.

I will update this list, whenever a closed source project becomes public, or I get the
**permission to use it in this list**.

If you are interested in **code samples** or more information on closed-source projects, please [contact](/contact) me.

Feel free to contribute to my **open-source** projects over at github!
